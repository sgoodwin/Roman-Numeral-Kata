This is a basic project to practice TDD/BDD.

This is based on videos like [this](http://t.co/lt184wZX) and isn't some new idea I had. 

Alot of the Cocoa community seems to not go for TDD/BDD/testing in general for the most part. Some I know do at least used tests to reproduce bugs and confirm that they've been defeated and stay defeated. The only Cocoa guys I know who do entirely-TDD/BDD tend to be Ruby/Rails converts. Interesting eh?
